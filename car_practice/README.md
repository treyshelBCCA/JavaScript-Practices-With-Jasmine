# README

You are to create a class object called Car that has the following features:

1. Allows the user to store make and model.
2. Holds the car's mileage (should default to 0)
3. Record the car's state (whether it is driving, parked, stopped)
4. Allow the user to drive the car (and add the miles driven to the mileage)
5. Allow the user to brake (stops the car)
6. Allow the user to park the car (only if it is stopped!)

Look at the test for further clues/ideas on how this should be implemented.

You cannot change any of the test code.

To run the tests open the index.html with live server.
