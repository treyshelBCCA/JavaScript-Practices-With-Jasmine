You are to create a class object called ATM that has the following features:

1. Allows the user to create an ATM that stores their first name and last name.
2. It should default to not being overdraft and a balance of 0.
3. It should allow you to deposit funds.
4. It should allow you to withdraw funds.
5. If you withdraw funds more than the current balance the account should become overdraft and not allow you to withdraw the funds.
6. If you become overdraft you should be able to deposit funds that allows you to not be overdraft any longer (0 or higher)
7. You should be able to check your balance (returns a string with the users name and their balance formatted properly for currency)
8. You should be able to check if you are overdraft (returns a string saying you are overdraft and by how much and the balance formatted properly for currency.)

Look at the test for further clues/ideas on how this should be implemented.

You cannot change any of the test code.

To run the tests open the index.html with live server.
