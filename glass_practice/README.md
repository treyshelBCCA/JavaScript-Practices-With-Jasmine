You are to create a class object called Glass that has the following features:

1. Allows the user to store the size of the glass (the capacity)
2. It should default to being empty (no water inside)
3. It should allow you to add a certain amount of water. (but if it would overflow only adds up to capacity)
4. It should allow you to remove water. (but not be a more than what is currently in the glass)
5. Allow you to empty the glass (dump out all water inside)
6. Allow you to fill the glass up to the top (add water to capacity)

Look at the test for further clues/ideas on how this should be implemented.

You cannot change any of the test code.

To run the tests open the index.html with live server.
